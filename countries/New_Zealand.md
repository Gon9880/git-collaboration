##  interesting trivia
Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whanau), sub-tribes (hapu) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira) whose position was subject to the community's approval.[275] The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,[276][277] particularly with the introduction of Christianity.[278] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples.[279] More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.

The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers.[280] Modesty was expected and enforced through the "tall poppy syndrome", where high achievers received harsh criticism.[281] At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country.[282] From the early 20th century until the late 1960s Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders.[259] In the 1960s, as higher education became more available and cities expanded[283] urban culture began to dominate.[284] Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities, much of New Zealand's art, literature, film and humour has rural themes. From around the middle of the 20th century, many cultural icons called Kiwiana, started to emerge that now help to define what it means to be a New Zealander; such as the silver fern and the paua shell.
